# Performance-ROI Analytics Framework using PVA

## Executive Summary
This project implements a sophisticated player performance evaluation system combining **Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (RAPM)** and **Statistical Plus-Minus (SPM)** methodologies. Using advanced statistical techniques including a multi-stage Bayesian analytics framework, and cross-validation, the system accurately predicts team performance and evaluates individual player contributions.

### Key Achievements:

- ðŸŽ¯ 0.848 correlation with actual league standings across 5 major competitions
- ðŸ“Š 79% accuracy within 3 positions for team ranking predictions
- ðŸ”„ 0.741-0.809 stability in year-over-year player ratings (1000+ minutes)
- âš¡ 2.1 average position difference between predicted and actual final standings

Business Impact: Enables data-driven decision making for efficiency, ROI, strategic planning, and performance optimization with quantifiable accuracy metrics.

## Methodology Overview
### Problem Statement
Traditional performance metrics fail to account for contextual factors such as teammate quality, opposition strength, and situational effects. This system addresses these limitations through advanced statistical modeling techniques.
### Solution Architecture
The system employs a three-stage approach:
1. RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus)
- Event-driven stint analysis isolating individual contributions
- Advanced regularization preventing overfitting
- Cross-game validation ensuring generalizability
2. SPM (Statistical Plus-Minus)
- Bayesian combination of multi-season priors with current performance
- Feature selection using elastic net regularization
- Reliability-based shrinkage for small sample sizes
3. Team Adjustments
- BPM-style team context incorporation
- League-specific performance normalization
- Cross-temporal validation


### Mathematical Framework
#### RAPM Model:
y_i = Î± + Î£(j=1 to N) Î²_j Ã— X_ij + Î£(k=1 to N) Î³_k Ã— D_ik + Îµ_i

Where:
- y_i = target metric for stint i
- Î± = intercept term (league average performance)
- X_ij = indicator for player j on offense
- D_ik = indicator for player k on defense
- Î²_j, Î³_k = player coefficients (estimated via regularization)
- Îµ_i = error term ~ N(0, ÏƒÂ²)

#### Regularization Strategy
To address multicollinearity in lineup data (especially in soccer, a sport where substitutions are limited) and prevent overfitting with high-dimensional sparse data, we apply Ridge (L2) regularization. Our objective function becomes:

Î²Ì‚ = argmin[||y - XÎ²||Â² + Î»||Î²||Â²]
      Î²

#### Design Matrix Construction with Data Duplication Strategy
The design matrix X employs a data duplication approach to ensure balanced offensive/defensive attribution:

##### Original Dataset (First Half):
X_ij = {
    +w_offensive  if player j is home team player
    +w_defensive  if player j is away team player
    0            otherwise
}
y_i = home_team_xG_i

##### Duplicated Dataset (Second Half):
X_ij = {
    +w_offensive  if player j is away team player  
    +w_defensive  if player j is home team player
    0            otherwise
}
y_i = away_team_xG_i


##### Complete Framework: 
Each stint generates two data points:

Home perspective: Home players = offense (+), Away players = defense (+), Target = Home xG
Away perspective: Away players = offense (+), Home players = defense (+), Target = Away xG

Rationale: This duplication strategy allows us to measure a player's offensive and defensive performances each game. The target variable (xG) switches accordingly, maintaining consistency between player assignments and the team performance they're attributed to.
