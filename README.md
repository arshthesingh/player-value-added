# Performance Analytics & ROI Optimization Pipeline

## Advanced Statistical Modeling for Resource Efficiency Analysis

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data science pipeline for performance analytics, featuring advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and automated data engineering. The system evaluates individual contributions within team environments using RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus), SPM (Statistical Plus-Minus), and WAR (Wins Above Replacement) methodologies - techniques applicable across sports, finance, operations, and human resources.

## Key Business Value

- Player Valuation: Quantify player contributions beyond traditional statistics
- Team Optimization: Identify inefficient wage spending and roster construction
- Predictive Analytics: Build models to forecast player performance across different contexts
- Market Efficiency: Analyze wage vs. performance relationships across competitions

## Architecture & Data Pipeline

### Technical Stack

Cloud Storage: AWS S3 for raw data ingestion
Data Warehouse: Google BigQuery for structured analytics
ETL: Automated Python pipelines with AWS EventBridge, Lambda
Processing: Pandas, NumPy for data transformation
ML Framework: Scikit-learn, SciPy for statistical modeling

## üß† Machine Learning Models
### 1. RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus)
**Problem**: High multicollinearity in team lineup data creates unstable coefficient estimates
**Solution**: Ridge regression with sparse matrix optimization for memory-efficient high-dimensional modeling

#### Key Features:
- Sparse Matrix Design: 6,566 player features with memory-efficient CSR matrices (mostly zeros)
- L2 Regularization: Ridge regression prevents overfitting with correlated lineup data
- Cross-Validation: GroupKFold ensures temporal validity across games
- Contextual Adjustments: Controls for teammate/opponent strength effects

### 2. SPM (Statistical Plus-Minus) with Bayesian Priors
- **Problem**: Traditional stats models don't account for small sample sizes and positional differences
- **Solution**: ElasticNet regression with Bayesian shrinkage toward multi-season priors

#### Technical Additions:
- Feature Engineering: 123 offensive, 91 defensive advanced soccer metrics
- Bayesian Shrinkage: Sigmoid reliability function based on playing time
- Position-Specific Models: Separate ElasticNet models for offensive and defensive contributions

### 3. Replacement Level & WAR Calculation
- **Problem**: Need baseline for "average" performance to measure true value
- **Solution**: Empirical replacement level from relegated team players

#### Applications:
- Transfer Strategy: Data-driven acquisition and contract decisions
- Squad Optimization: Optimal team composition within Financial limits and regulations
- Performance Benchmarking: Cross-league player comparison
