# Performance-ROI Analytics Framework using PVA

## What is PVA?

**PVA, or Player Value Added** is a statistical model that attempts to estimate a soccer player's individual contribution to their team's expected goal difference (xGD) per 90. The overall metric is an estimate of the player's contribution over a single season, although their contributions from previous seasons are used as priors.
